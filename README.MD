# CallKit UI experiments 

Quick test of CallKit UI. All the app does at the moment it shows native incoming call screen when *Incoming Call* button is pressed.

It also makes attempt to show outgoing call but it's shown only on the lock screen.


## Nest step

1. Investigate how much incoming screen is customizable?
2. Is there a native screen for an outgoing screen?
3. What kind of certificate is required for PushKit
